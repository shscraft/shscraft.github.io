			Render Distance, Max Framerate, FXAA Antialiasing, and Fog are the most important. DO NOT SET YOUR RENDER DISTANCE TO ANYTHING HIGHER THAN 2.

    <div id="reveal">These computers have incredibly bad CPU's, 2 gigabytes of ram, and quite literally no GPU. It's quite honestly a miracle that Minecraft, even this old of a version and this heavily optimised runs at all.<br>
	Cutting down the render distance to 1 GREATLY increases performance due to how awful the chromebooks specs are, as rendering chunks is usually a task handled by the GPU (which we don't have).<br>
	The same thing applies to Fog and FXAA Antialiasing, as these are also very reliant on the GPU. Fog is kind of like a shader, disabling also increases visibility. FXAA Antialiasing is a GPU intensive Antialiasing method.<br>
	Setting Max Framerate to unlimited is just a weird quirk of vanilla Minecraft that made its way over into this port, where disabling the maximum framerate gives you a higher framerate.<br>
	Finally, reasons your settings may reset is either due to you playing the game on a different computer, you clearing your browsers cookies/cache, or I had to migrate the server to a new website.<br>
	Anyways, if you actually read that all good job, and even better job if you understood it. Have a great day
